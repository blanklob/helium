## Before we start

Before the installation and setup, this workflow is intended for developers who want to start a Shopify theme from scratch, loaded with boilerplate code, ready to scale with styling architectures and a section/components approache to fulfill Shopify theme development best practices.


## Building themes with sections and blocks

When you're designing a theme, you should consider when to provide functionality in a section or a block. Sections and blocks are modular components that give merchants the opportunity to customize and extend their theme. Merchants can add and remove sections and theme blocks, adjust section and block settings, and introduce app blocks and metafields.

### Sections

Sections are available on all pages. You should ensure that your theme template's default content is available in a main template section, and that sections can be added, removed, and reordered. You can use sections to do the following:

- To add, remove, or reorder content at the template level.
- To control theme settings that are scoped to the entire section's layout and content.


### Blocks 

You should provide theme blocks to add, remove, or reorder content at the section level, or when it enhances the usability of a section. Keep the following principles in mind when developing blocks:

- Ensure that the theme settings are scoped to the block.
- Choose a block layout that is appropriate for the content, and ensure that your blocks flow logically regardless of block type or sequence.
- Select an appropriate flexibility level to introduce using blocks.
