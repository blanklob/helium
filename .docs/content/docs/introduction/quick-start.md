## Requirements

### Nodejs

Workflow uses yarn to centralize dependency management, making it easy to update build tooling, plugins, and build scripts:

- Download and install [NodeJS v14+](https://nodejs.org/).
- Download and install [Yarn v1.22+](https://yarnpkg.com/) for your platform.


### Shopify CLI

You also need to install the Shopify CLI, it replaces Theme Kit for most Shopify theme development tasks, it also accelerates your theme development process with the following features

- Safely preview, test, and share changes to themes using development themes.
- Hot reload changes when previewing a theme.
- Push/pull and publish themes from the command line.
- Populate test data for your theme, including products, customers, and draft orders.

Follow these steps to install [Shopify CLI v2.22+](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/installation) first.
