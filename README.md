- Safely preview, test, and share changes to themes using development themes
- Hot reload SCSS and section changes when previewing a theme
- Push/pull and publish themes from the command line
- Populate test data for your theme, including products, customers, and draft orders
- and more !

#### To install it on macOS use either [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

#### **RubyGems.org**

In a new terminal window, navigate to your home directory and run the following command:

```shell
gem install shopify-cli
```

#### **Homebrew**

You need to add Shopify's third-party repositories to Homebrew before you can install Shopify CLI.

```shell
brew tap shopify/shopify
brew install shopify-cli
```

**Verify the installation**

To verify that Shopify CLI is installed properly, run the following command:

```shell
shopify version
```

#### To learn how to install Shopify CLI on Windows or Linux refer to the other installation guides [here](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/installation).

## ‚ö°Ô∏èGetting started

To get started, install the templates either by cloning this repository or using the shopify cli init command like so:

```shell
shopify theme init -u https://github.com/younessidbakkasse/workflow
```

This command will prompt you to choose a Theme name then clones the template to your local machine.

Then all you have to do is to install npm dependencies using the yarn command:

```shell
yarn install
```

After that, run the development server using the command below:

```shell
yarn start
```

## ‚úÖCommands

```shell
yarn start
```

- To only run the shopify development server, same as `shopify theme serve`

```shell
yarn serve
```

- To watch over static file changes, this will run webpack bundling for the development configuration.

```shell
yarn watch
```

- To build static files for production (minification, ...) run the command below.

```shell
yarn build
```

- To run shopify theme linting use the command.

```shell
yarn lint
```

- This command packages your local theme files into a ZIP file that can be uploaded to Shopify.

```shell
yarn zip
```

- Run Shopify theme linting manually.

```shell
yarn format
```

- Fix auto simple liquid bugs same as `shopify theme check -a`.
