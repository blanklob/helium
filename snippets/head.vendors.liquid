  To keep it clean, use this to add third party CDN libaries,
  tho it's recommended to use ES6 imports in order to build your
  libaries in vendors assets, since it's faster to serve files
  on shopify CDN.

  Check for more info: https://github.com/Shopify/theme-check/blob/main/docs/checks/remote_asset.md

  Usage:
  {%- render 'head.vendors' -%}

  Content:
    Vanilla-lazyload:
    - description: lightweight, flexible lazyloading script
    - docs: <https://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/vanilla-lazyload/>

<!-- Start vendor third party libaries -->
